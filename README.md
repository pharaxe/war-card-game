# War Card Game
This project holds a special place in my heart because it was one of my first experiences in JavaScript.

Writing this project was also one of my first experiences with software estimation. I was asked how long I needed to write it, and I said 3 days. It took me closer to 3 weeks.

# Install
This was made before JavaScript bundlers. So "installing" it involves:

1. Cloning the repo
2. Pointing Apache or Nginx to the directoy to serve up `war.html`

I've included the necessary libry files in the repo.

# Test
There's a test page at `test.html`. This let me test the game without manually clicking or waiting around.
